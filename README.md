# classClock
This is my final project for the fullstack JavaScript session with Code Louisville. 

As an elementary classroom teacher, I was constantly trying to remember various scheduled activities for individual students, small groups, and the whole class. While teaching a reading group, for example, I may have to stop and remind a student to head to an ESL or Speech session. During one-on-one or small group instruction, the other students may have to manage themselves in computer or other learning center times. This constant divided attention results in what I am calling "teacher brain". My application is designed to minimize this stress as much as possible.

When complete, the application will allow a teacher to input all the scheduled reminders they wish to track. Then, they can open the browser window and leave Class Clock running in the background while normal activities continue. At the scheduled times, a reminder will popup on the screen, reminding students what they need to do. The goal is to allow teachers to concentrate more on the task at hand and allow students to take more ownership for their own daily routine and time commitments.
