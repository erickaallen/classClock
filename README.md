This is my final project for the fullstack JavaScript session with Code Louisville.

## References

This is a learning project for me. As such, it is heavily commented so I can refer back to it later. Many of these comments are directly from MEAN Machine: The Beginner's Guide to the JavaScript Stack, by Chris Sevilleja and Holly Lloyd. This book was invaluable assistance.
